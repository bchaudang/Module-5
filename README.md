# Module-5 Challenge
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  This assignment had started out relatively easy in terms of applying what was taught and what I had learned in class through the activities for the preparing the data and generating general summaries. However, I did encounter quite a few roadblocks. Firstly, while creating bar and pie charts, though my code was running successfully, with the charts appearing, they were all overlapping eachother within one cell. After the aid of askBcs, it was determined that I was using the interactive line for matplotlib (%matplotlib notebook).
  Secondly, I had originally seperated all four drug regimens and created codes to calculate the quartiles, IQR and outliers into different cells, and then created my box plot. However, after askBCS and the aid of my tutor, it was clear, based on the grading rubric of the assignment that I was to create an empty list, as well as creating a for loop to determine my values rather than indivually as I had done. This assignment was quite difficult during the lower sections, but with the aid of askBcs Learning assisstants, an amazing tutor, as well as other classmates that have created a study group, it was extremely helpful to be able to discuss different techniques that were being used. Overall, this assignment has been the most challenging thus far, but yet also the most interesting to learn and apply the codes.
